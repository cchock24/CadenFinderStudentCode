| Oct 30  | 9:30-10:05  | I made a binary search tree which works; however, for product it has a really long run time, probably because of the barcodes, so I'm going to try and implement hashing to make the comparisons shorter.

I added Insert, Resize, Query. Currently the code works however its timing out so I need to make it more efficient. |
